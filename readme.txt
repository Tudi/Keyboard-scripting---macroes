Keyboard filter driver that you can code at your will. Module for gameoverlay project.

What it can do :
- negate keypresses
- reroute keypresses
- execute scripts on keypresses
- execute scripts based on timer
- remote console based command execution
- low latency 100% precise timed keypressing. Perfect spell cast rotation in 1 button press ?
- 0 interaction with target application. It should be illegal for you to get banned for using this

I used this project quite a lot in D3 to get achievements. Over 100 hours.
